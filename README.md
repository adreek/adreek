I am a medical student at the University of Toronto. My research interests include using maching learning to determine clinically-significant associations and develop new tools to better care for patients. Working with the Division of Urology at the Hospital for Sick Children (Toronto, ON), we have developed numerous tools to standardize vesicoureteral reflux grading, determine prognosis in children with posterior urethral valve, and predict post-operative complications.

I have previously worked extensively in the field of memmbrane biophysics at the Department of Physics and Astronomy at McMaster University with <a href="http://www.rheinstaedter.de/maikel/">Dr. Maikel C. Rheinstadter</a>. We provided new insights on the mechanisms of bacterial resistance for polymyxin antibiotics, developed new techniques for structural analysis of lipid membranes, and worked on the aggregation of peptides in neurodegenerative diseases.
