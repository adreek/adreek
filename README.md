I am a medical student at the University of Toronto. My research interests in basic science include using physical chemistry to understand human disease. Using techniques from molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, x-ray crystallography, and spectroscopy, I hope to find new ways to quantify biological processes in disease.

Working with <a href="https://www.leelab-utoronto.com/">Dr. Jeffrey E. Lee</a>. in the Department of Laboratory Medicine and Pathobiology, I am researching the immune escape of viral proteins and cell-cell fusion mechanisms through MD simulations. We use Markov-state modelling, hybrid quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics and conventional MD simulations on SciNet to understand these topics.

As an undergraduate student, I researched with <a href="http://www.rheinstaedter.de/maikel/">Dr. Maikel C. Rheinstadter</a> at McMaster University in the broad field of membrane biophysics. We provided new insights on the mechanisms of bacterial resistance for polymyxin antibiotics, developed new techniques for structural analysis of lipid membranes, and worked on the aggregation of peptides in neurodegenerative diseases.
