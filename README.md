I am a medical student at the University of Toronto. Currently, I am using maching learning to determine clinically-significant associations and develop new tools to better care for patients. My other research interests include evidence-based medicine and clinical outcomes research, but I do enjoy dabbling in biophysics from time to time.

Working with the Division of Urology at the Hospital for Sick Children (Toronto, ON), we have developed numerous tools to standardize vesicoureteral reflux grading, determine prognosis in children with posterior urethral valve, and predict post-operative complications after pyeloplasty. We hope to bring these clinical tools to improve practice in pediatric urology. I have also worked on developing machine learning tools to determine surgical approach in prostate cancer with the Division of Urology at University Health Network (Toronto, ON).

I have previously worked extensively in the field of memmbrane biophysics at the Department of Physics and Astronomy at McMaster University with <a href="http://www.rheinstaedter.de/maikel/">Dr. Maikel C. Rheinstadter</a>. We provided new insights on the mechanisms of bacterial resistance for polymyxin antibiotics, developed new techniques for structural analysis of lipid membranes, and worked on the aggregation of peptides in neurodegenerative diseases.
